# Warning

This is Higly experimental, SLOW and BUGGY.

# What is it? Why ZenBrowser?

I create this browser as a small experiment to see what a minimalistic web could look like.

It has the following features :

- No Javascript support
- No AD
- No Style
- Trying To show the important content only.

# Why is the default page buggy?

I choose to default the start page to hackerNews as it is a great source of fresh content. However, the browser do not successfully render this page correctly for now :(
